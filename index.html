            Hello! My name is Mathews Chipeta, from Johannesburg in a small town named Benoni
            and I am currently enrolled in the WDD 130 course. I have a passion for
            web development and design, and I am excited to learn more about creating dynamic and responsive websites.

            Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.
            It is the provincial capital of Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa.
            The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills and is the center of large-scale
            gold and diamond trade.
